# ctrl-alt-elite-74-demo-site

This is merely a demo site I built to show students how CSS can be used to create a modern, responsive, brochue page.  It features flex box, grid, responsiveness at all sizes, and showcases BEM styling.  Hosted on Github Pages at https://hirejohnloveland.github.io/ctrl-alt-elite-74-demo-site/
