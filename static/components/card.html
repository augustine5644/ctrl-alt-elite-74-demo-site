        <p class="card__text">Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming
          language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data
          structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it
          very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use
          as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components
          together. </p>
